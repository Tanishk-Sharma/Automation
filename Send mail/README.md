# Send Mail

Sending mails is one of the most important aspect of Business. 
They help us relay messages to Clients, Teams, Users, etc.

# Why automation?

Through automation of sending mails, we give our scripts to communicate to us with either a Success or Error mail.
This is widely used in IT allowing troubleshooting proactively and manage outages.
It is a form of alerting/notifying of some info.

I have used some Regex also here. Find it in the script. Have fun.
