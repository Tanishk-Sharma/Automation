# Zip Creator

Zip files are a great way of sharing data. 

## Why not share the folder/directory itself?

That's a good question! And quite confusing until you see the challenges with folders. 

Reason why Zip files are great:

* Zip File is treated like a single file, whereas, a folder is a group of files.
* Many Softwares work with only zip files and won't let you upload folders.
* One great thing - zip files are compressed! 

# How the program works?

Just enter the folder containing the files to be zipped
A second input is the target zip file path, eg. /home/sysacc/all_zips/zipfile_20201022.zip
